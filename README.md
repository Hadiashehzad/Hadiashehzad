## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hadia!

ðŸŽ“ **About Me**  
Iâ€™m a recent graduate from LUMS, where I studied Data Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science. My journey into machine learning began with a love for solving real-world problems, from analyzing survey data in the public sector to training deep learning models for computer vision tasks. I've worked on a range of projects, including fraud detection using LSTM, license plate recognition using YOLO and SuperPoint-SuperGlue, and building sentiment classifiers for local language text. I also have a growing interest in LLMs and generative AI, particularly for low-resource language settings. I have obtained an IBM Data Science professional certificate from Coursera.

My work experience bridges research, data science, and advocacy â€” from being a Research Assistant in AI and Deep Learning courses to contributing to field projects on early childhood education and gender discrimination in digital platforms.
